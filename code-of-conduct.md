- **Honest Disclosure**: Accurately disclose how your MCP handles data, what external services it connects to, and any known limitations.
- **Respectful Collaboration**: Provide constructive feedback. Disagree on technical merits, not personal attributes.
- **Responsible Security**: Report security vulnerabilities privately to compliance@easypa.ai before public disclosure.
